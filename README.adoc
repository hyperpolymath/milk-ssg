**The definitive COW esoteric language static site generator.**

== Overview

milk-ssg is a static site generator written in the COW esoteric programming
language. It proves that even the most unconventional languages can be used
to build functional tools.

== Language Enforcement

[IMPORTANT]
====
This SSG **MUST** be written in COW. No exceptions.

Forbidden languages for SSG logic:

* Python
* JavaScript/TypeScript
* Brainfuck (use COW)
* Any language other than COW

The **ONLY** non-COW code allowed is the ReScript MCP adapter in `adapters/`.
====

== COW Language

COW is a Brainfuck variant with bovine-themed commands:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Command | Action
| moo | Conditional skip (if memory is zero, skip to MOO)
| mOo | Move memory pointer back
| moO | Move memory pointer forward
| mOO | Execute value at current memory as instruction
| Moo | Input (if memory is zero) or output ASCII
| MOo | Decrement memory
| MoO | Increment memory
| MOO | Loop end (if memory is non-zero, jump back to moo)
| OOO | Set current memory to zero
| MMM | If memory is zero, copy previous. Else copy to previous
| OOM | Print memory as integer
| oom | Read integer to memory
|===

== Requirements

* COW interpreter (or bundled interpreter)
